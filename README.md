# GlassDoorApp

3rd Party Libraries Chosen are: 
Retrofit for Networking - I chose this library becauseit  makes downloading JSON or XML data from a web API relatively straightforward.

I also used Kotlin Coroutines because they allow me to make non-blocking asynchronous calls with clear and linear code.
